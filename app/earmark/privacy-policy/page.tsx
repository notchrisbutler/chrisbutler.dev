              <p>
                At Earmark, we believe your financial data belongs to you and only you. We've designed our app with privacy as the fundamental principle, not as an afterthought. This privacy policy explains our approach to data management and protection.

              <h2>App Permissions</h2>
              <p>
                Earmark requires minimal permissions to function:
              </p>
              <ul className="feature-list">
                <li className="feature-item">
                  <strong>Storage Permission:</strong> Only to save your financial data locally on your device.

                <li className="feature-item">
                  We do not request access to your contacts, location, camera, or other sensitive device features.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Any future updates that might require additional permissions will be clearly explained, and will only be implemented if they directly enhance the local budgeting functionality of the app.

            <div className="mb-5">
              <h2>Security</h2>
              <p>
                While the security of your data is primarily dependent on your device's security measures, we've implemented the following:
              </p>
              <ul className="feature-list">
                <li className="feature-item">

                <li className="feature-item">
                  We recommend enabling your device's security features (PIN, fingerprint, face recognition) to protect access to the app.
                </li>
                <li className="feature-item">
                  The app can optionally require authentication each time you open it, for additional security.

              <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                Earmark is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since the app stores all data locally, parents should monitor their children's use of devices where the app is installed.

              <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
              <p>
                If we make changes to our Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and notify users within the app. Since our core privacy principle is to never collect or transmit user data, any policy changes would only reflect clarifications, new features that maintain these principles, or legal requirements.
